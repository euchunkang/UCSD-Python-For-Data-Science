# UCSD-Python-For-Data-Science
This repository contains the projects completed as part of UCSanDiegoX's Python for Data Science course.

For the mini project, the notebook 'Soccer Mini Project', basic data exploratory analysis was practiced and some basic statistical tools were used.

For the final project, the notebook 'Breast Cancer Classification', machine learning algorithms were used to predict whether a tumour was malignant or benign.
The different models were evaluated and chosen for the final prediction model.
